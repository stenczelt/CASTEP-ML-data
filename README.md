# Research data for "Machine-learned acceleration for molecular dynamics in CASTEP"
This repository contains data and code supporting the following work:

> T. K. Stenczel, Z. El-Machachi, G. Liepuoniute, J. D. Morrow, A. P. Bart&oacute;k, M. I. J. Probert, G. Cs&aacute;nyi, V. L. Deringer, _in preparation_ (2023).

The purpose is to allow readers to reproduce the results of the paper, and also to design their own benchmarks, tests, and more. It is _not_ meant as the primary repository for the up-to-date version of the code: for this, please visit https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP.

## Contents

This repository contains the following:

* **The code** (`hybrid-md.py`) which is interfaced to CASTEP
* **Simulation results** for aluminium oxide (original CASTEP output and trajectories in concatenated `.xyz` format) and the carbon graphitisation runs (original CASTEP and LAMMPS outputs, fitted models, DFT-labelled structural data in exteneded '.xyz' format and relevant input files)
